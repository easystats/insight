\title{Find names of all variables}
\usage{
find_variables(
  x,
  effects = c("all", "fixed", "random"),
  component = c("all", "conditional", "zi", "zero_inflated", "dispersion",
    "instruments", "smooth_terms"),
  flatten = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model.}

\item{effects}{Should variables for fixed effects, random effects
or both be returned? Only applies to mixed models. May be abbreviated.}

\item{component}{Should all predictor variables, predictor variables for the
conditional model, the zero-inflated part of the model, the dispersion
term or the instrumental variables be returned? Applies to models
with zero-inflated and/or dispersion formula, or to models with instrumental
variable (so called fixed-effects regressions). May be abbreviated. Note that the
\emph{conditional} component is also called \emph{count} or \emph{mean}
component, depending on the model.}

\item{flatten}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the values are returned
as character vector, not as list. Duplicated values are removed.}
}
\value{
A list with (depending on the model) following elements (character
vectors):
\itemize{
\item \code{response}, the name of the response variable
\item \code{conditional}, the names of the predictor variables from the \emph{conditional} model (as opposed to the zero-inflated part of a model)
\item \code{random}, the names of the random effects (grouping factors)
\item \code{zero_inflated}, the names of the predictor variables from the \emph{zero-inflated} part of the model
\item \code{zero_inflated_random}, the names of the random effects (grouping factors)
\item \code{dispersion}, the name of the dispersion terms
\item \code{instruments}, the names of instrumental variables
}
}
\description{
Returns a list with the names of all variables, including
response value and random effects.
}
\note{
The difference to \code{\link[=find_terms]{find_terms()}} is that \code{find_variables()}
returns each variable name only once, while \code{find_terms()} may return a
variable multiple times in case of transformations or when arithmetic expressions
were used in the formula.
