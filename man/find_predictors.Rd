\title{Find names of model predictors}
\usage{
find_predictors(
  x,
  effects = c("fixed", "random", "all"),
  component = c("all", "conditional", "zi", "zero_inflated", "dispersion",
    "instruments", "correlation", "smooth_terms"),
  flatten = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model.}

\item{effects}{Should variables for fixed effects, random effects
or both be returned? Only applies to mixed models. May be abbreviated.}

\item{component}{Should all predictor variables, predictor variables for the
conditional model, the zero-inflated part of the model, the dispersion
term or the instrumental variables be returned? Applies to models
with zero-inflated and/or dispersion formula, or to models with instrumental
variable (so called fixed-effects regressions). May be abbreviated. Note that the
\emph{conditional} component is also called \emph{count} or \emph{mean}
component, depending on the model.}

\item{flatten}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the values are returned
as character vector, not as list. Duplicated values are removed.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors that represent the name(s) of the
predictor variables. Depending on the combination of the arguments
\code{effects} and \code{component}, the returned list has following
elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{conditional}, the "fixed effects" terms from the model
\item \code{random}, the "random effects" terms from the model
\item \code{zero_inflated}, the "fixed effects" terms from the zero-inflation component of the model
\item \code{zero_inflated_random}, the "random effects" terms from the zero-inflation component of the model
\item \code{dispersion}, the dispersion terms
\item \code{instruments}, for fixed-effects regressions like \code{ivreg}, \code{felm} or \code{plm}, the instrumental variables
\item \code{correlation}, for models with correlation-component like \code{gls}, the variables used to describe the correlation structure
}
}
\description{
Returns the names of the predictor variables for the
different parts of a model (like fixed or random effects, zero-inflated
component, ...). Unlike \code{\link[=find_parameters]{find_parameters()}}, the names from
\code{find_predictors()} match the original variable names from the data
that was used to fit the model.

\examples{
data(mtcars)
m <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + vs, data = mtcars)
find_predictors(m)
