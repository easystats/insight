\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{effects}{Should variables for fixed effects, random effects
or both be returned? Only applies to mixed models. May be abbreviated.}

\item{component}{Should all predictor variables, predictor variables for the
conditional model, the zero-inflated part of the model, the dispersion
term or the instrumental variables be returned? Applies to models
with zero-inflated and/or dispersion formula, or to models with instrumental
variable (so called fixed-effects regressions). May be abbreviated. Note that the
\emph{conditional} component is also called \emph{count} or \emph{mean}
component, depending on the model.}

\item{flatten}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the values are returned
as character vector, not as list. Duplicated values are removed.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors that represent the name(s) of the
predictor variables. Depending on the combination of the arguments
\code{effects} and \code{component}, the returned list has following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{conditional}, the "fixed effects" terms from the model
\item \code{random}, the "random effects" terms from the model
\item \code{zero_inflated}, the "fixed effects" terms from the zero-inflation
component of the model
\item \code{zero_inflated_random}, the "random effects" terms from the zero-inflation
component of the model
\item \code{dispersion}, the dispersion terms
\item \code{instruments}, for fixed-effects regressions like \code{ivreg}, \code{felm} or \code{plm},
the instrumental variables
\item \code{correlation}, for models with correlation-component like \code{gls}, the
variables used to describe the correlation structure
}
}
\description{
Returns the names of the predictor variables for the
different parts of a model (like fixed or random effects, zero-inflated
component, ...). Unlike \code{\link[=find_parameters]{find_parameters()}}, the names from
\code{find_predictors()} match the original variable names from the data
that was used to fit the model.
}
\section{Model components}{

Possible values for the \code{component} argument depend on the model class.
Following are valid options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}: returns all model components, applies to all models, but will only
have an effect for models with more than just the conditional model component.
\item \code{"conditional"}: only returns the conditional component, i.e. "fixed effects"
terms from the model. Will only have an effect for models with more than
just the conditional model component.
\item \code{"smooth_terms"}: returns smooth terms, only applies to GAMs (or similar
models that may contain smooth terms).
\item \code{"zero_inflated"} (or \code{"zi"}): returns the zero-inflation component.
\item \code{"dispersion"}: returns the dispersion model component. This is common
for models with zero-inflation or that can model the dispersion parameter.
\item \code{"instruments"}: for instrumental-variable or some fixed effects regression,
returns the instruments.
\item \code{"location"}: returns location parameters such as \code{conditional},
\code{zero_inflated}, \code{smooth_terms}, or \code{instruments} (everything that are
fixed or random effects - depending on the \code{effects} argument - but no
auxiliary parameters).
\item \code{"distributional"} (or \code{"auxiliary"}): components like \code{sigma}, \code{dispersion},
\code{beta} or \code{precision} (and other auxiliary parameters) are returned.
