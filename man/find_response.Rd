\title{Find name of the response variable}
\usage{
find_response(x, combine = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model.}

\item{combine}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} and the response is a matrix-column,
the name of the response matches the notation in formula, and would for
instance also contain patterns like \code{"cbind(...)"}. Else, the original
variable names from the matrix-column are returned. See 'Examples'.}
}
\value{
The name(s) of the response variable(s) from \code{x} as character
vector, or \code{NULL} if response variable could not be found.
}
\description{
Returns the name(s) of the response variable(s) from a model object.
