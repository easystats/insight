\title{Get residual standard deviation from models}
\usage{
get_sigma(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A model.}
}
\value{
The residual standard deviation (sigma), or \code{NULL} if this information could not be accessed.
}
\description{
Returns the residual standard deviation from classical
and mixed models.
}
\details{
\subsection{Interpretation of Sigma}{
The residual standard deviation, \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;}}{\eqn{\sigma}},
indicates that the predicted outcome will be within +/- \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;}}{\eqn{\sigma}}
units of the linear predictor for approximately 68\\% of the data points
(\cite{Gelman, Hill & Vehtari 2020, p.84}). In other words, the residual
standard deviation indicates the accuracy for a model to predict scores,
thus it can be thought of as \dQuote{a measure of the average distance
each observation falls from its prediction from the model}
(\cite{Gelman, Hill & Vehtari 2020, p.168}). \ifelse{html}{\out{&sigma;}}{\eqn{\sigma}}
can be considered as a measure of the unexplained variation in the data,
or of the precision of inferences about regression coefficients.
}
\subsection{Calculation of Sigma}{
By default, \code{get_sigma()} tries to extract sigma by calling
\code{stats::sigma()}. If the model-object has no \code{sigma()} method,
the next step is calculating sigma as square-root of the model-deviance
divided by the residual degrees of freedom. Finally, if even this approach
fails, and \code{x} is a mixed model, the residual standard deviation is
accessed using the square-root from \code{get_variance_residual()}.
