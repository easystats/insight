get_df(x, ...)

\method{get_df}{default}(x, type = "residual", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A statistical model.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{type}{Can be \code{"residual"}, \code{"wald"}, \code{"normal"}, or
\code{"model"}. \code{"analytical"} is an alias for \code{"residual"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"residual"} (aka \code{"analytical"}) returns the residual degrees of
freedom, which usually is what \code{\link[stats:df.residual]{stats::df.residual()}} returns. If a
model object has no method to extract residual degrees of freedom, these
are calculated as \code{n-p}, i.e. the number of observations minus the number
of estimated parameters. If residual degrees of freedom cannot be extracted
by either approach, returns \code{Inf}.
\item \code{"wald"} returns residual (aka analytical) degrees of freedom for models
with t-statistic, \code{1} for models with Chi-squared statistic, and \code{Inf} for
all other models. Also returns \code{Inf} if residual degrees of freedom cannot
be extracted.
\item \code{"normal"} always returns \code{Inf}.
\item \code{"model"} returns model-based degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of
(estimated) parameters.
\item For mixed models, can also be \code{"ml1"} (or \code{"m-l-1"}, approximation of
degrees of freedom based on a "m-l-1" heuristic as suggested by \emph{Elff et
al. 2019}) or \code{"between-within"} (or \code{"betwithin"}).
\item For mixed models of class \code{merMod}, \code{type} can also be \code{"satterthwaite"}
or \code{"kenward-roger"} (or \code{"kenward"}). See 'Details'.
}

Usually, when degrees of freedom are required to calculate p-values or
confidence intervals, \code{type = "wald"} is likely to be the best choice in
most cases.}

\details{
\strong{Degrees of freedom for mixed models}

Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
for such inferential statistics (see \emph{Li and Redden 2015}).

\emph{m-l-1 degrees of freedom}

The \emph{m-l-1} heuristic is an approach that uses a t-distribution with fewer
degrees of freedom. In particular for repeated measure designs (longitudinal
data analysis), the m-l-1 heuristic is likely to be more accurate than simply
using the residual or infinite degrees of freedom, because \code{get_df(type = "ml1")}
returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster and between-cluster
effects. Note that the "m-l-1" heuristic is not applicable (or at least less
accurate) for complex multilevel designs, e.g. with cross-classified clusters.
In such cases, more accurate approaches like the Kenward-Roger approximation
is recommended. However, the "m-l-1" heuristic also applies to generalized
mixed models, while approaches like Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite are limited
to linear mixed models only.

\emph{Between-within degrees of freedom}

The Between-within denominator degrees of freedom approximation is, similar
to the "m-l-1" heuristic, recommended in particular for (generalized) linear
mixed models with repeated measurements (longitudinal design).
\code{get_df(type = "betwithin")} implements a heuristic based on the between-within
approach, i.e. this type returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster
and between-cluster effects. Note that this implementation does not return
exactly the same results as shown in \emph{Li and Redden 2015}, but similar.

\emph{Satterthwaite and Kenward-Rogers degrees of freedom}

Unlike simpler approximation heuristics like the "m-l-1" rule (\code{type = "ml1"}),
the Satterthwaite or Kenward-Rogers approximation is also applicable in more
complex multilevel designs. However, the "m-l-1" or "between-within" heuristics
also apply to generalized mixed models, while approaches like Kenward-Roger
or Satterthwaite are limited to linear mixed models only.
