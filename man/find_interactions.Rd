\title{Find interaction terms from models}
\usage{
find_interactions(
  x,
  component = c("all", "conditional", "zi", "zero_inflated", "dispersion", "instruments"),
  flatten = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model.}

\item{component}{Should all predictor variables, predictor variables for the
conditional model, the zero-inflated part of the model, the dispersion
term or the instrumental variables be returned? Applies to models
with zero-inflated and/or dispersion formula, or to models with instrumental
variable (so called fixed-effects regressions). May be abbreviated. Note that the
\emph{conditional} component is also called \emph{count} or \emph{mean}
component, depending on the model.}

\item{flatten}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the values are returned
as character vector, not as list. Duplicated values are removed.}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors that represent the interaction terms.
Depending on \code{component}, the returned list has following
elements (or \code{NULL}, if model has no interaction term):
\itemize{
\item \code{conditional}, interaction terms that belong to the "fixed
effects" terms from the model

\item \code{zero_inflated}, interaction terms that belong to the "fixed
effects" terms from the zero-inflation component of the model

\item \code{instruments}, for fixed-effects regressions like \code{ivreg},
\code{felm} or \code{plm}, interaction terms that belong to the
instrumental variables
}
}
\description{
Returns all lowest to highest order interaction terms from a model.
}
\examples{
data(mtcars)

m <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + vs, data = mtcars)
find_interactions(m)

m <- lm(mpg ~ wt * cyl + vs * hp * gear + carb, data = mtcars)
find_interactions(m)
}
