## Bug fixes

### `get_data()`

* Fixed issue in `get_data()` for `MixMod` objects, which were caused due to
  internal changes in *GLMMadaptive*.

  scientific formatted extreme values.

  of numbers if these have more decimal places than indicated by `digits`.

  `get_data()` should return all variables on the original scale (as if these
  variables were not transformed), as stated in the docs.

  correctly identified.

* Fixed issue in `get_priors()` for *brmsfit* models, where parameters of

  since it was unclear if the function checked the entered object was a model or
  a supported model in *insight*. The new `is_model()` function checks if the
  entered object is a model object, while `is_model_supported()` checks if a
  supported model object.

## New functions

  contained matrix variables (like splines).

* `get_priors()` swapped column names `location` and `scale` for *brmsfit*
  -objects.
