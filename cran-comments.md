## revdepcheck results

We checked 33 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 1 new problem
 * We failed to check 0 packages

We saw one error (failing example) for the *marginaleffects* package. This is expected, the maintainer is informed and has prepared an update of *marginaleffects*, which can be submitted once *insight* is accepted on CRAN.
