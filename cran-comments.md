- This release fixes some isues related to the recent update of the *glmmTMB* package.

- Furthermore, this release is a prerequisite to submit a fix for the "performance" package. Due recent changes in this package, 'insight' must be submitted first.

- Finally, in this release we deprecated older arguments, which will likely lead to warnings in downstream packages. We have prepared fixes for all affected packages and can submit updates once 'insight' is accepted on CRAN.
