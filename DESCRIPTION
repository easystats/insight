Title: Easy Access to Model Information for Various Model Objects
Description: A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to 
   information contained in various R models, like model formulas, model terms, 
   information about random effects, data that was used to fit the model or 
   data from response variables. 'insight' mainly revolves around two types 
   of functions: Functions that find (the names of) information, starting with 
   'find_', and functions that get the underlying data, starting with 'get_'. 
   The package has a consistent syntax and works with many different model 
   objects, where otherwise functions to access these information are missing.
