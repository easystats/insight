Description: A tool to provide an easy, intuitive and consistent
    access to information contained in various R models, like model
    formulas, model terms, information about random effects, data that was
    used to fit the model or data from response variables. 'insight'
    mainly revolves around two types of functions: Functions that find
    (the names of) information, starting with 'find_', and functions that
    get the underlying data, starting with 'get_'.  The package has a
    consistent syntax and works with many different model objects, where
    otherwise functions to access these information are missing.
